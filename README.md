# /coffee

/coffee is a slash command to organize coffee runs through slack.

Each run is created on a channel level, meaning that different channels can have separate runs simultaneously (if you have a global team, for example).

## Installation

Visit [coffee.agelber.com](http://coffee.agelber.com) and you can follow the instructions from there.

If you don't want to install this through the Slack app directory, you could deploy it on your own and add a custom integration through the Slack admin panel.

## Usage

There are 5 commands to know:

#### `/coffee run [time]`

Start a coffee run!  
example: `/coffee run 15`

#### `/coffee list`

Show the list of orders for the current run.  
example: `/coffee list`

#### `/coffee order [item]`

Order something from the current run.  
example: `/coffee order small cappuccino`

#### `/coffee here`

Let everyone know that the coffee is here!
This is needed so that others can start new runs later on.  
example: `/coffee here`

#### `/coffee help`

Show a help message detailing the available commands.  
example: `/coffee help`
